Content model is defined per document `type` (see docmodel).


## Example rich paragrap

Plain text content.
Inline `tag`s.
Tags may be specialized through custom element names.
Specialized tags may define attribute rules.
Tags may contain tags.


## Example unit editors

 * `grid-row`
 * `source` with `language`, rendered as `pre` with syntaxhighlighting

Some of which may partially or entirely incorporate features of the rich paragrapt.
